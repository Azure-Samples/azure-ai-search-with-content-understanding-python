{"Retrieval Augmented Generation with Content Understanding\n\nThis notebook provides an example of the Retrieval Augmented Generation\n(RAG) pattern for Document Modality.\n\nLeveraging Azure AI's Content Understanding Layout analysis, it extracts\ntables, paragraphs, and layout information from PDF files. The resulting\nmarkdown output can be utilized with LangChain's markdown header\nsplitter, facilitating semantic chunking of documents. These chunked\ndocuments are then indexed into the Azure AI Search vector store. When a\nuser query is received, Azure AI Search retrieves the relevant chunks,\nwhich are subsequently used to generate a context-aware response.\n\nPre-requisites\n\n1.  Follow README to create essential resource that will be used in this\n    sample\n2.  Install required packages\n\n    %pip install -r ../requirements.txt\n    ! pip install python-dotenv langchain langchain-community langchain-openai langchainhub openai tiktoken azure-identity azure-search-documents": null}
