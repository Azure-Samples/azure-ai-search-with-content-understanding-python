# Azure AI Content Understanding Samples (Python)

Welcome! Content Understanding is a solution that analyzes and comprehends various media content, such as **documents, images, audio, and video**, transforming it into structured, organized, and searchable data.

- The samples in this repository default to the latest preview API version: **(2024-12-01-preview)**.

## Features

Azure AI Content Understanding is a new Generative AI-based [Azure AI service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/overview), designed to process/ingest content of any type (documents, images, audio, and video) into a user-defined output format. Content Understanding offers a streamlined process to reason over large amounts of unstructured data, accelerating time-to-value by generating an output that can be integrated into automation and analytical workflows.

## Samples

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [field_extraction.ipynb](notebooks/field_extraction.ipynb) | Extract custom fields with sample analyzer templates |
| [content_extraction.ipynb](notebooks/content_extraction.ipynb) | Extract structured content from your input files |
| [analyzer_training.ipynb](notebooks/analyzer_training.ipynb) | Provide training data to improve the quality of your analyzer |


## Getting started
### GitHub Codespaces
You can run this repo virtually by using GitHub Codespaces, which will open a web-based VS Code in your browser.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?skip_quickstart=true&machine=basicLinux32gb&repo=899687170&ref=main&geo=UsEast&devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Fdevcontainer.json)

### Local environment

1. Make sure the following tools are installed:

    * [Azure Developer CLI (azd)](https://aka.ms/install-azd)
    * [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Make a new directory called `azure-ai-content-understanding-python` and clone this template into it using the `azd` CLI:

    ```shell
    azd init -t azure-ai-content-understanding-python
    ```

    You can also use git to clone the repository if you prefer.

## Configure Azure AI service resource
### (Option 1) Use `azd` commands to auto create temporal resources to run sample
1. Login Azure
    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```
1. Setting up environment, following prompts to choose location
    ```shell
    azd up
    ```


### (Option 2) Manually create resources and set environment variables
1. Create [Azure AI Services resource](docs/create_azure_ai_service.md)
1. Go to `Access Control (IAM)` in resource, grant yourself role `Cognitive Services User`
1. Copy `notebooks/.env.sample` to `notebooks/.env`
1. Fill **AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT** with the endpoint from your Azure portal Azure AI Services instance.

## Open a Jupyter notebook and follow the step-by-step guidance

Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and select the sample notebook you are interested in. Since Codespaces is pre-configured with the necessary environment, you can directly execute each step in the notebook.
